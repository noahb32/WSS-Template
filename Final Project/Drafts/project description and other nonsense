This project aims to implement systematic randomness testing into the Wolfram Language through both theoretically–designed tests and Monte Carlo–designed tests. The tests use a sequence of either zeros and ones or reals between zero and one as input. The tests return a p–value evaluating the null hypothesis that the sequence is indeed random. The general design of the tests is to first create a test statistic based on some property of random sequences. A sampling distribution is then derived either theoretically or using a Monte Carlo method in order to generate the p–values.
